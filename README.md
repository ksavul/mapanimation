# Real-Time Bus Tracker

## Description
The Real-Time Bus Tracker is an interactive web application that allows users to track the movement of buses in real-time on a map. Powered by the Mapbox GL JS library, this project provides a visual representation of bus locations and their routes. It aims to enhance the usability and convenience of public transportation by providing users with up-to-date information on bus positions.

## How to Run
To run the Real-Time Bus Tracker on your local machine, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository to your computer.
2. Obtain a Mapbox API access token by signing up at Mapbox.
3. In the `index.html` file, replace `YOUR_MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN` with your actual Mapbox access token. This is required for the map to load correctly.
4. Open the modified `index.html` file in a web browser.
5. The map will be displayed with markers representing the current positions of the buses.
6. Observe the bus markers moving in real-time as they update their positions.

**Note:** An internet connection is necessary to load the Mapbox GL JS library and the map tiles.

## Roadmap for Future Improvements
Here are some potential future improvements to consider for enhancing the Real-Time Bus Tracker:

1. **Bus Route Information:** Display additional information about bus routes, such as stops, schedules, and estimated arrival times.
2. **Bus Tracking Filter:** Implement a filtering mechanism to allow users to select specific bus routes or filter by destination.
3. **Live Updates:** Integrate real-time data feeds from transit agencies to provide instant updates on bus locations and delays.
4. **User Notifications:** Enable push notifications or alerts to inform users of important updates, such as route changes or disruptions.
5. **User-Friendly Interface:** Improve the user interface with intuitive controls, clear map markers, and a responsive design for various devices.
6. **Historical Data Analysis:** Incorporate historical data analysis to identify trends, optimize routes, and improve overall transportation efficiency.

By implementing these improvements, the Real-Time Bus Tracker can offer a more comprehensive and user-friendly experience for tracking buses in real-time.
