# Map Animation Project

## Description
The Map Animation Project showcases an interactive map powered by the Mapbox GL JS library. It features a marker that dynamically moves between pre-defined bus stops in Scotland, providing real-time tracking and visualization. The project demonstrates the capabilities of Mapbox GL JS for creating engaging maps and simulating marker movement.

## How to Run
To run this project on your machine, please follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Obtain a Mapbox API access token by signing up at [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/).
3. In the `index.html` file, replace the placeholder `YOUR_MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN` with your actual Mapbox access token. This is necessary for the map to load properly.
4. Open the modified `index.html` file in a web browser.
5. The map will be displayed with a marker positioned at the initial bus stop location in Scotland.
6. Click the "Suggested tour of Scotland" button to initiate the animation and observe the marker's movement between bus stops.

Note: An internet connection is required to load the Mapbox GL JS library and the map tiles.

## Roadmap of Future Improvements
Possible future improvements for this project include:
- Allowing users to select different tours or customize their own routes.
- Displaying additional information or points of interest for each bus stop.
- Enhancing the visual appearance of the marker's movement, such as adding a trail or animation effects.
- Implementing user interaction features like dragging the marker or zooming in/out on the map.
